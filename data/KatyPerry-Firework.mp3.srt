1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, 
drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin, 
like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you ever feel, already buried deep, 
six feet under screens and no one seems to hear a thing?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Do you know that there's, still a chance for you, 
cause there's a spark in you?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You just gotta ignite the light, 
and let it shine, just own the night, 
like the 5th of July.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Cause baby you're a firework, 
come on show em what you're worth.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Make em go ah, ah, ah, as you shoot across the sky.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Cause baby you're a firework, 
come on let your colors burst.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Make em go ah, ah, ah, 
you're gonna leave em all in awe.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't have to feel, like a wasted space, 
your original, cannot be replaced.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you only knew, what the future holds, 
after a hurricane, comes a rainbow.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Maybe a reason why, all the doors are closed, 
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow, 
and when it's time you'll know.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine, 
just own the night, like the 5th of July.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Cause baby you're a firework, 
come on show em what you're worth.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Make em go ah, ah, ah, 
as you shoot across the sky.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Baby you're a firework, 
come on let your colors burst.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Make em go ah, ah, ah, 
you're gonna leave em all in awe.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Boom, boom, boom, 
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's always been inside of you, you, you, 
and now it's time to let it through.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Cause baby you're a firework, 
come on show em what you're worth.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Make em go ah, ah, ah, 
as you shoot across the sky.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Baby you're a firework, 
come on let your colors burst.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Make em go ah, ah, ah, 
you're gonna leave em all in awe.

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Boom, boom, boom, 
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Boom, boom, boom, 
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon.
